===================================

The Generic Quest Library for Android (GQL8) helps you create questionnaires within an Android application. 
A questionnaire is defined within a very simple JSON file. Then the library dynamically creates and displays the questionnaire as a set of ordered Android activities. Results are returned as a JSON array of values.

See more information about this library and a full example [here](http://www.catedrasaes.org/wiki/CarimQuestionnaires).
